== Execution Environments

WNScript currently has several modes of compilation and execution.

|====
|Mode                | Description
|llvm-jit-engine     |
  In this mode, WNScripts can be directly executed from C/C++ code. The
script is compiled on first use, and a function pointer is obtainable from
the scripting engine.
|c-generation        |
  Instead of running any scripts, WNScripts can be translated into equivalent
C code.
|c-engine (planned)  |
  A set of files created from the c-generation step, after having been compiled
into a shared library (.so/.dll) file can be loaded and run using the same
machinery as llvm-jit-engine.
|c-program (planned) |
  Same as c-generation but additional C code is emitted to allow the resulting
script to be run as a sandalone executable.

NOTE: This is going to expand in the future.
